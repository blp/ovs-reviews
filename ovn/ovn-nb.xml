<database name="ovn-nb" title="OVN Northbound Database">
  <p>
    This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
    (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it.  The CMS produces almost all of
    the contents of the database.  The <code>ovs-nbd</code> program monitors
    the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the <ref
    db="OVN"/> database.
  </p>

  <p>
    We generally speak of ``the'' CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
    which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment.
  </p>

  <h2>External IDs</h2>

  <p>
    Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named
    <code>external_ids</code>.  This column has the same form and purpose each
    place it appears.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>external_ids</code>: map of string-string pairs</dt>
    <dd>
      Key-value pairs for use by the CMS.  The CMS might use certain pairs, for
      example, to identify entities in its own configuration that correspond to
      those in this database.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <table name="Logical_Switch" title="L2 logical switch">
    <p>
      Each row represents one L2 logical switch.  A given switch's ports are
      the <ref table="Logical_Port"/> rows whose <ref table="Logical_Port"
      column="switch"/> column points to its row.
    </p>

    <column name="router_port">
      <p>
        The router port to which this logical switch is connected, or empty if
        this logical switch is not connected to any router.  A switch may be
        connected to at most one logical router, but this is not a significant
        restriction because logical routers may be connected into arbitrary
        topologies.

  <table name="Logical_Port" title="L2 logical switch port">
    <p>
      A port within an L2 logical switch.
    </p>

    <column name="switch">
      The logical switch to which the logical port is connected.
    </column>

    <column name="name">
      The logical port name.  The name used here must match those used in the
      <ref key="iface-id" table="Interface" column="external_ids"
      db="Open_vSwitch"/> in the <ref db="Open_vSwitch"/> database's <ref
      table="Interface" db="Open_vSwitch"/> table, because hypervisors use <ref
      key="iface-id" table="Interface" column="external_ids"
      db="Open_vSwitch"/> as a lookup key for logical ports.
    </column>

    <column name="up">
      This column is populated by <code>ovn-nbd</code>, rather than by the CMS
      plugin as is most of this database.  When a logical port is bound to a
      physical location in the OVN database <ref db="OVN" table="Bindings"/>
      table, <code>ovn-nbd</code> sets this column to <code>true</code>;
      otherwise, or if the port becomes unbound later, it sets it to
      <code>false</code>.  This allows the CMS to wait for a VM's networking to
      become active before it allows the VM to start.
    </column>

    <column name="macs">
      The logical port's own Ethernet address or addresses, each in the form
      <var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>.
      Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has a single
      fixed Ethernet address.  The string <code>unknown</code> is also allowed
      to indicate that the logical port has an unknown set of (additional)
      source addresses.
    </column>

    <column name="port_security">
      <p>
        A set of L2 (Ethernet) or L3 (IPv4 or IPv6) addresses or L2+L3 pairs
        from which the logical port is allowed to send packets and to which it
        is allowed to receive packets.  If this column is empty, all addresses
        are permitted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exact syntax is TBD.  One could simply use comma- or space-separated L2
        and L3 addresses in each set member, or replace this by a subset of the
        general-purpose expression language used for the <ref column="match"
        table="Pipeline" db="OVN"/> column in the OVN database's <ref
        table="Pipeline" db="OVN"/> table.

  <table name="ACL" title="Access Control List (ACL) rule">
    <p>
      Each row in this table represents one ACL rule for the logical switch in
      its <ref column="switch"/> column.  The <ref column="action"/> column for
      the highest-<ref column="priority"/> matching row in this table
      determines a packet's treatment.  If no row matches, packets are allowed
      by default.  (Default-deny treatment is possible: add a rule with <ref
      column="priority"/> 0, <code>true</code> as <ref column="match"/>, and
      <code>deny</code> as <ref column="action"/>.)
    </p>

    <column name="switch">
      The switch to which the ACL rule applies.  The expression in the
      <ref column="match"/> column may match against logical ports
      within this switch.
    </column>

    <column name="priority">
      The ACL rule's priority.  Rules with numerically higher priority take
      precedence over those with lower.  If two ACL rules with the same
      priority both match, then the one actually applied to a packet is
      undefined.
    </column>

    <column name="match">
      The packets that the ACL should match, in the same expression language
      used for the <ref column="match" table="Pipeline" db="OVN"/> column in
      the OVN database's <ref table="Pipeline" db="OVN"/> table.  Match
      <code>inport</code> and <code>outport</code> against names of logical
      ports within <ref column="switch"/> to implement ingress and egress ACLs,
      respectively.  In logical switches connected to logical routers, the
      special port name <code>ROUTER</code> refers to the logical router port.
    </column>

    <column name="action">
      <p>The action to take when the ACL rule matches:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <code>allow</code>: Forward the packet.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <code>allow-related</code>: Forward the packet and related traffic
	  (e.g. inbound replies to an outbound connection).
	</li>

	<li>
	  <code>drop</code>: Silently drop the packet.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <code>reject</code>: Drop the packet, replying with a RST for TCP or
	  ICMP unreachable message for other IP-based protocols.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </column>

    <column name="log">
      If set to <code>true</code>, packets that match the ACL will trigger a
      log message on the transport node or nodes that perform ACL processing.
      Logging may be combined with any <ref column="action"/>.

    </p>

    <column name="ip">
      The logical router's own IP address.  The logical router uses this
      address for ICMP replies (e.g. network unreachable messages) and other
      traffic that it originates and responds to traffic destined to this
      address (e.g. ICMP echo requests).
